      <h2>Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>

        The website and Services are not intended for children under the age of 18. If you are under
        18 years old, please do not provide personally identifiable information of any kind
        whatsoever on the website or Services. We do not intentionally gather Personal Information

      <h2>Anonymous Website Visitors</h2>
      <p>
        Like other website operators, CodePortal may collect non-personally-identifying information
        that web browsers make available, such as referring site, date and time of visitor&#x27;s
        request or browser name about users who anonymously interact with the website.
        CodePortal&#x27;s purpose in collecting such general information is to better understand how
        CodePortal visitors use the website and how the website could be improved accordingly.
        CodePortal does not make public any specific reports on visitor search, browsing or
        interaction with the CodePortal website.
      </p>
      <h2>Registered Website Users</h2>
      <p>
        CodePortal collects personal information from users that voluntarily register with the
        service and who agree to submit such information. Users share such information in order to
        be able to engage in CodePortal activities. By registering on the CodePortal website users
        are consenting to collection, use and storage of personal data in accordance with this
        Privacy Policy.
