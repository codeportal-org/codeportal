        Last updated: June 12, 2023.
        <br />
        <br />
        Please read these Terms of Use (&quot;Terms&quot;, &quot;Terms of Use&quot;) carefully
        before using the codeportal.io website, or apps (the &quot;Service&quot;) operated by
        CodePortal (&quot;us&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, or &quot;our&quot;).
        <br />
        <br />
        Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance
        with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who wish to access or

        <br />
      </h2>
      <p>
        By creating an Account on our service, you agree to subscribe to newsletters, marketing or
        promotional materials and other information we may send. However, you may opt out of
        receiving any, or all, of these communications from us by following the unsubscribe link or
        instructions provided in any email we send.
      </p>
      <h2>Purchases</h2>
      <p>
        If you wish to purchase any product or service made available through the Service
        (&quot;Purchase&quot;), you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to your
        Purchase including, without limitation, your credit card number, the expiration date of your
        credit card, your billing address, and your shipping information.
        <br />
        <br />
        You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right to use any credit card(s) or
        other payment method(s) in connection with any Purchase; and that (ii) the information you
        supply to us is true, correct and complete.
        <br />
        <br />
        The service may employ the use of third party services for the purpose of facilitating
        payment and the completion of Purchases. By submitting your information, you grant us the
        right to provide the information to these third parties subject to our Privacy Policy.
        <br />
        <br />
        We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order at any time for reasons including but
        not limited to: product or service availability, errors in the description or price of the
        product or service, error in your order or other reasons.
        <br />
        <br />
        We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order if fraud or an unauthorized or illegal
        transaction is suspected.
      </p>
      <h2>Availability, Errors and Inaccuracies</h2>
      <p>
        We are constantly updating product and service offerings on the Service. We may experience
        delays in updating information on the Service and in our advertising on other web sites. The
        information found on the Service may contain errors or inaccuracies and may not be complete
        or current. Products or services may be mispriced, described inaccurately, or unavailable on
        the Service and we cannot guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any information found on
        the Service.We therefore reserve the right to change or update information and to correct
        errors, inaccuracies, or omissions at any time without prior notice.
      </p>
      <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
      <p>
        Some parts of the Service may be billed on a subscription basis
        (&quot;Subscription(s)&quot;). You may be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic
        basis (&quot;Billing Cycle&quot;). Billing cycles may be set on a monthly basis. At the end
        of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription may automatically renew under the exact same
        conditions unless you cancel it or CodePortal cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription
        renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting the CodePortal
        customer support team.
        <br />
        <br />A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, may be required to process
        the payment for your Subscription. In such a case, you would need to provide CodePortal with
        accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code,
        telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment
        information, you automatically authorize CodePortal to charge all Subscription fees incurred
        through your account to any such payment instruments.
        <br />
        <br />
        Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, CodePortal may issue an electronic
        invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the
        full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.
      </p>
      <h2>Price and Fee Changes</h2>
      <p>
        CodePortal, in its sole discretion and at any time in any manner, may adjust or introduce
        new fees or pricing for any element of our Service. Any Subscription fee change will become
        effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.
        <br />
        <br />
        CodePortal would provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription
        fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes
        effective. Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into
        effect would constitute your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.
      </p>
      <h2>Refunds</h2>
      <p>Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable.</p>
      <h2>Chargebacks</h2>
      <p>
        If you have a dispute concerning any payment transaction, please contact us at
        likableapps@gmail.com. If, at any time, you contact your bank or credit card company to
        reject the charge of any payable fees (“Chargeback”), this act will be considered a breach
        of your payment obligations, and we reserve the right to automatically terminate your use of
        the Services. We reserve the right to dispute any Chargeback and take all reasonable action
        to authorize the transaction. In the event of a Chargeback, your account may be terminated
        and any files, data, or content contained in your account may be subject to cancellation. We
        will not be liable for any loss of files, data or content as a result of a Chargeback.

      </p>
      <h2>Interactions With Other Users</h2>
      <p>
        You Have Sole Responsibility When Interacting with Other Users. Our Service provide a
        platform for users to connect with one another, in order to communicate. CodePortal is not a
        party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties as to,
        and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions,
        interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other user, person or
        organization. You are solely responsible for your interactions with other users of our
        Service. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between you
        and other users of our Service.
        <br />
        <br />
        Remember, the CodePortal Service is just a platform that enables you to communicate and
        interact with other people in your neighborhood and around the world. We cannot be
        responsible for the interactions that you have with other CodePortal users, so please use
        good judgment and keep safety in mind when you use our Service.
        <br />
        <br />
        We cannot and do not confirm each user’s identity. You are solely responsible for
        determining the identity and suitability of others with whom you may interact through our
        Service. CodePortal does not represent or warrant that our Service is sufficient to
        determine whether it is appropriate for you to interact with another user. Further, we do
        not endorse any persons who use or register for our Service. We do not investigate or verify
        any user’s reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or any information users may
        submit to the Service. We encourage you to take precautions when interacting with other
        users, particularly when meeting a stranger in person for the first time.
        <br />
        <br />
        CodePortal users may organize in-person meetings and host events for other CodePortal users;
        however, these events are not sponsored or endorsed by CodePortal and users attend such
        meetings and events at their own risk.
        <br />
        <br />
        Because our Service is merely a platform, in the event that you have a dispute with one or
        more users, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law you release us (and our
        officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from claims, demands and
        damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected
        and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such
        disputes. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code 1542, which
        says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or
        suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him
        must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”
      </p>
      <h2>User Conduct</h2>
      <p>
        By accessing or using the Service, you agree to act responsibly and exercise good judgment.
        In addition, you agree not to: (a) use the Service in violation of any applicable law or
        regulation, including promoting or encouraging any illegal activity; (b) infringe the rights
        of any third party, including without limitation, intellectual property, privacy, publicity
        or contractual rights; (c) use the Service in any manner that could interfere with, disrupt,
        negatively affect or inhibit other users from fully enjoying the Services or that could
        damage, disable, overburden or impair the functioning of the Service in any manner; (d) post
        any information that is abusive, threatening, obscene, defamatory, libelous, or racially,
        sexually, religiously, or otherwise objectionable and offensive; (e) use our Service in
        connection with the distribution of spam (which we define as unsolicited bulk e-mail or any
        other unsolicited messages of a commercial, religious, romantic, political or other nature
        not within the intended purposes of the Service); (f) stalk, intimidate, threaten or
        otherwise harass or cause discomfort to any other user of our Service; (g) register for more
        than one member account or use another user’s account without permission; (h) impersonate
        any person or entity, or falsify or otherwise misrepresent yourself or your affiliation with
        any person or entity, whether by providing or omitting to provide information; (i)
        circumvent or attempt to defeat any security or verification measure relating to use of the
        Service; (j) hold yourself out as an agent, representative, employee or affiliate of
        CodePortal, including but not limited to when you host an event for other CodePortal users;
        (k) use the website or any of its contents to advertise or solicit, for any commercial
        purpose or to compete, directly or indirectly, with our Service; (l) bypass any robot
        exclusion headers or other measures we take to restrict access to the Service or use any
        software, technology, or device to scrape, spider, or crawl the Service or harvest or
        manipulate data; or (m) assist any third party in doing any of the foregoing.
        <br />
      </p>
      <h2>Reporting Misconduct</h2>
      <p>
        If you interact with anyone through our Service who you feel is acting or has acted
        inappropriately, including but not limited to offensive, violent or sexually inappropriate
        behavior, who steals from you or engages in any other disturbing conduct, we strongly
        encourage you to immediately report such person to the appropriate authorities and to us by
        contacting us. Please note that although we encourage you to report misconduct, we are not
        responsible or liable for our users’ actions, and we are not obligated to take any action.
        <br />
      </p>
      <h2>Copyright Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We respect the intellectual property of others and ask that users of our website and
        Services do the same. In connection with our Services and in accordance with the Digital
        Millennium Copyright Act’s (“DMCA”), we have adopted and implemented a policy respecting the
        copyright laws that provide for the removal of any infringing materials and for the
        termination, in appropriate circumstances, of users of our online Services who are repeat
        infringers of intellectual property rights, including copyrights. If you believe that one of
        our users is, through the use of our Services, unlawfully infringing the copyright(s) in a
        work, and wish to have the allegedly infringing material removed, the following information
        in the form of a written notification (pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)) must be provided to
        our designated Copyright Agent: (a) your physical or electronic signature; (b)
        identification of the copyrighted work(s) that you claim to have been infringed; (c)

        request us to remove; (d) sufficient information to permit us to locate such material; (e)
        your address, telephone number, and e-mail address; (f) a statement that you have a good
        faith belief that use of the objectionable material is not authorized by the copyright
        owner, its agent, or under the law; and (g) a statement that the information in the
        notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are either the owner of the
        copyright that has allegedly been infringed or that you are authorized to act on behalf of
        the copyright owner.
        <br />
        <br />
        Please note that, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), any misrepresentation of material fact
        (falsities) in a written notification automatically subjects the complaining party to
        liability for any damages, costs and attorney’s fees incurred by us in connection with the
        written notification and allegation of copyright infringement.
