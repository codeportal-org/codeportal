# Self Hosting (Work in progress...)

Placeholder for the self-hosting docs. This docs are in progress ...

## Requirements

This project is now dependant on a few third parties, for some of them we might make them replaceable or have minimal in-house solutions in the future. For now, you need to use the following third parties to self-host this project:

- [Clerk](https://clerk.dev) for authentication.
- [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com) for the database. This one is arguably the easiest to replace, you just need to configure the database connection. However, we plan to make it dead simple to do so.
