# What is Code?

Code is structured data that describes computation. At the most basic level it is a tree of nodes connected in different ways following certain rules. We can categorize these nodes into two three types:

- Declarations.
- Expressions.
- Statements.

Declarations create a new identifier in the current scope, a memory position that can be referenced later. They are usually used to create variables, functions, etc.

Expressions are nodes that can be evaluated to a value. They can be used in statements to perform operations.

Statements are nodes that perform an action. They can contain expressions.
