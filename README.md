## Intro

CodePortal is an open-source GUI-based (not text-based), web-based programming language and platform that tries to remove as much clutter and unnecessary complexity as possible out of programming. A few key features that set it apart from other programming languages and platforms are:

- It stores code as a graph of nodes and connections in a database, not as text files. This is a more natural medium for code and it is easier to work with. It enables a lot of things that are more difficult or impossible with text files.
- Every node or part of the code is addressable by a unique ID.
- The UI is block-based/node-based, not text-based. This makes it easier to work with and more intuitive.
- It is a full-stack platform, not just a language. It is a complete solution for building web applications and APIs.
- It is a web-based platform, so it is easy to use and accessible from anywhere. It is also easy to share and collaborate with others.
- For the server side, it uses an interpreter which allows for instant deployments and updates. No need to compile or restart the server (inspired by Darklang).

## Why

I wanted to code in a better way, a way that removed all the clutter from programming and let me flow and just create stuff. I tried all kinds of things, many programming paradigms, lots of editors, lots of programming languages, even no-code and low-code tools but those are limiting and you sacrifice power and flexibility. I rather code things most of the time, however those have their place and I use them when it makes sense.

I never found a good answer! Maybe, I am too picky or too demanding, some people say so! ha ha! ðŸ˜… Also, most approaches and efforts that attempted to radically improve programming have failed or died - I keep a list of them. Some still exist, but they have not gained enough adoption, or they are thriving in a niche. BTW, thriving in a niche is great! It is a good use case for those tools. There are structured editors like Scratch and Snap but they are mostly for education and/or niche applications not for general purpose stuff.

I have learned from all these efforts, from the mistakes, and from the good things. So I set out to create a new programming language and platform that is simple, and smooth with a focus on developer experience. Something that is easy to use and flexible enough to create any type of application without sacrificing power and flexibility. Web-based of course, at least for now.

That's CodePortal. I would not call it no-code because it **IS** code, also is not low-code, because it very close to it. So, I think a more proper name for it is **new-code**. It is a new way to code. I borrowed this from the SQL -> NoSQL -> NewSQL evolution and I think it fits well.

## Getting Started

Go to [codeportal.io](https://codeportal.io), create an account and start using it. It's free to start and then usage based. You can also host it yourself, I will add instructions on how to do that soon.
